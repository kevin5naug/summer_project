# 2018 Summer Project

Two summer research projects are being developed here. 
One is genetic algorithm with novelty search, inspired by the Uber paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567.
The other one is more about music segmentation. There isn't much prior work for this field. We are purely experimenting whether Bi-LSTM+CRF can work here.
